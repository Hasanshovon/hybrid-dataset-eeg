After PCA
[coeff,score,latent,tsquared,explained] = pca(hb);

explained =

   99.9996
    0.0003
    0.0001
    0.0000
    0.0000
    0.0000
..........
First 3 components explain 100% variability

But still took first 10 principal components

numberOfDimensions = 10;
coeff = pca(hb_2);
reducedDimension = coeff(:,1:numberOfDimensions);
reducedData = hb_2 * reducedDimension;
>> HB = [reducedData hb(:,51)];
